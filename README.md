# [Project 1: Data Fun With House Prices](https://github.com/JulMeh/Data-fun-with-house-prices) 
I started this Kaggle competition by focusing on getting a good understanding of the data set. Steps I did in the project:
* A detailed EDA is detailed and visualizations are included.
* Preprocessing:
  * Dealing with NA's, Skewness and kurtosis, outliers, feature engineering, one hot encoding and so on.
* Modelling with Lasso and Xgboost
