# [Project 1: Data Fun With House Prices](https://github.com/JulMeh/houseprices) 
I started this Kaggle competition by focusing on getting a good understanding of the data set. Steps I did in the project:
* A detailed EDA is detailed and visualizations are included.
* Preprocessing:
  * Dealing with NA's, Skewness and kurtosis, outliers, feature engineering, one hot encoding and so on.
* Modelling with Lasso and Xgboost

(Other stuff in this report: A self-made function, regression matrix, a randomeforst to identify the most important variables) 

# [Project 2: Classification of mushrooms](https://github.com/JulMeh/mushrooms)
I wanted to combine my classification skills with a beautiful visualization. For this reason I started this project. The following is included in this project:
* Simple application of: RT, gb and xgb
* Advanced application: of ggplot2 with loops and own functions

# Coming soon: Deep dive into tidymodels
* EDA: With advanced use of ggplt
* Preprocessing and modelling with: rsample, recipes, tune
